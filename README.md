# Adopet

## :pencil:Description

This project was a initiative of Alura where We should simulate a real project.  
A site should be built using a Figma model and the activities was managed by Trello platform. 

Adopet is a platform to assist and simplify the animals adoption.  
User should create an account and fill the profile form in order to be eligible for the adoption process.  
To begin the adoption process, user needs send us a form containing the animal name (our lovely animals can be found on the homepage) and contact details. The user profile will be analyzed and after user will be contacted by our team. 

<!-- The main project functionality is to enable the user to share its codes in a easy way by using highlight.js library,
and exporting it as an image. -->
